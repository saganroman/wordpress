*** Installing WordPress Themes via Admin Panels (packed template)
-------------------------------
To install the downloaded template (.zip) via WordPress administration panels please follow these steps:
1. Log in to the WordPress Administration Panels..
2. Select the Appearance panel, then Themes.
3. Select "Add New".
4. Choose "Upload".
5. Click the "Choose file" button to select the zip file from your computer and press "Install now".
6. Click "Activate" to make the installed theme default.

NOTE: Before installing a new theme, please make sure there is no theme installed with the same name. In case such theme exists, rename or delete it before installing a new theme with the same name. 


*** Installing WordPress Themes via FTP (unpacked template)
-------------------------------
Many servers use the default limit of 2 MB on the maximum file size. If this is the case with your server, some template files are considered as too big and cannot be uploaded by using the "Upload&Install" button. In this case please use the method below.

To install template via FTP you should upload unpacked template to the server using your favorite FTP software.

Be sure you upload (copy+paste) the theme folder to the directory: /path_to_wordpress/wp-content/themes/ - where /path_to_wordpress/ is the location of your WordPress installation on the server. 

After making sure your theme folder is successfully moved to "Themes" folder, log in to your WordPress Back-End, go to Appearance - Themes, choose the theme and press "Activate" to activate it.
